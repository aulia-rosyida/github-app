    private val veggieDetails = arrayOf("Beets and beet juice are great for improving heart health, as the vegetable is rich in heart-healthy nitrates. A small 2012 study reports that drinking 500 g of beet juice significantly lowered blood pressure in healthy people. These vegetables may also benefit people with diabetes. Beets contain an antioxidant called alpha-lipoic acid, which might be helpful for people with diabetes-related nerve problems, called diabetic neuropathy.",
        "Sweet bell peppers may be red, yellow, or orange. Unripe, green bell peppers are also popular, though they taste less sweet. Bell peppers are extremely versatile and can be easy to incorporate into pasta, scrambled eggs, or a salad. A person might also enjoy them sliced with a side of guacamole or hummus.",
        "Broccoli is a cruciferous vegetable that is high in vitamins C and A. Cruciferous vegetables also have lots of antioxidant polyphenols. One cup of cooked broccoli florets contains 5.1 g of fiber (15.2 percent of AI).",
        "Each cup of chopped carrots contains 52 calories and over four times an adult’s daily recommended intake of vitamin A, in the form of beta carotene. Vitamin A is vital for healthy eyesight, and getting enough of this nutrient may help prevent vision loss. Certain nutrients in carrots may also have cancer-fighting properties. A 2018 review of 10 articles reports that dietary carrot intake was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer.",
        "cauliflower and other cruciferous vegetables contain an antioxidant called indole-3-carbinol. Research has linked this compound with cancer-combatting effects in animals. However, confirming the effects in humans requires more research. A person can pulse raw cauliflower in a blender to make cauliflower rice or turn it into a pizza base for a low-calorie, comforting treat. People may also enjoy cauliflower in curries or baked with olive oil and garlic.",
        "Garlic is a natural antibiotic. For example, a 2018 review notes that people have used garlic for purposes similar to those of antibiotics since the 16th century. Allium, a component of garlic, may be the source of its health benefits. Confirming this will require more research. Heating garlic reduces its health benefits, so it is best to eat garlic raw, in bruschetta or dips, for example.",
        "Kale is a green, leafy, cruciferous vegetable that is rich in nutrients. It may offer a range of health benefits for the whole body. Kale contains fiber, antioxidants, calcium, vitamins C and K, iron, and a wide range of other nutrients that can help prevent various health problems. Antioxidants help the body remove unwanted toxins that result from natural processes and environmental pressures. hey note that antioxidants, such as vitamin C and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), can help reduce complications that may occur with diabetes. Both of these antioxidants are present in kale.",
        "Onions and other allium vegetables, including garlic, contain sulfur compounds. Review studies, including a 2019 review and a 2015 review, suggest that these compounds may help protect against cancer. It can be easy to incorporate onions into soups, stews, stir-fries, and curries. To get the most from their antioxidants, eat them raw — in sandwiches, salads, and dips such as guacamole.",
        "Peas are a sweet, starchy vegetable. Peas and other legumes contain fiber, which supports good bacteria in the gut and helps ensure regular bowel movements and a healthy digestive tract. They are also rich in saponins, plant compounds that may help protect against oxidative stress and cancer. It might be handy to keep a bag of peas in the freezer and gradually use them to boost the nutritional profiles of pasta dishes, risottos, and curries. A person might also enjoy a refreshing pea and mint soup.",
        "Seaweed is one of the few plant-based sources of the omega-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid. These are essential for health and are mostly present in meat and dairy. Each type of seaweed has a slightly different nutritional profile, but they are typically rich in iodine, which is an essential nutrient for thyroid function. Also, many types of seaweed contain chlorophyll, which is a plant pigment that has anti-inflammatory properties.")
